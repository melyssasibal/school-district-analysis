# School District Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to provide insight on high school reading and math scores across 15 high schools in one school district. The sample included 39,170 students. Results were first cleaned to removed unnecessar prefixes and suffixes from student names. Average scores and passing percentages were calculated for the entire district and within each school. Average scores and passing percentages were further analyzed by grade within each schools, school budget, school size, and school type. This process was completed twice. The first was completed with the entire sample. The second was conducted omitting scores of 461 9th grade students from Thomas High School. This report illuminates on how removing data can alter results. 

## Results 
### District Summary Results 
District summary with complete data

- There are differences in average math scores (change of 0.1), and percentages in students passing math (0.2%) and overall (0.1%). These difference may show the Thomas High School ninth graders contributed to a higher average math score. The change in percentage may have resulted in the inconsistency between decimal places. Oddly, while the average reading score is the same, there is a decrease of 0.3% in the percentage in students passing reading after the omission of the ninth grade sample. This again could be due to the inconsistent formatting.

- Similiarly to the district analysis, the school summary analysis is inconsistent with significant digits across the two samples. While the differences are small, it is difficult to determine if it is a difference in average score or if it is a difference due to rounding errors.

### Performance Comparison 
Despite removing the ninth grade scores from Thomas High School, the school still remains the second top performing school of the sample.
