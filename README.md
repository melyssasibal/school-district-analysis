# School District Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to provide insight on high school reading and math scores across 15 high schools in one school district. The sample included 39,170 students. Results were first cleaned to removed unnecessary prefixes and suffixes from student names. Average scores and passing percentages were calculated for the entire district and within each school. Average scores and passing percentages were further analyzed by grade across schools,  by school budgets, school size, and school type. This process was completed twice. The first with the entire sample. The second was conducted without scores from 9th grade students from Thomas High School. This report illuminates on how removing data can alter the results.
